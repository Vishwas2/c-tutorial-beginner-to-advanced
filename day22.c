// WHY IS RECURSION NOT ALWAYS GOOD ?

/*
-> Recursion is a good approach when it comes to problem solving.
-> However, programmer needs to evaluate the need and impact of using iterative/recursive approach while solving a particular problem.
-> In case of factorial calculation, recursion saved alot of lines of code.
-> However in the case of fibonacci series, recursion resulted in some extra unnecessary function calls which was an extra overhead.
-> Running time for fibonacci series grows exponentially with input in case of recursive approach.
